DECISION TREES INTRODUCTION (DT)

DT can be used in two ways:

1. Classification
2. Regression (As used above)

Most of the time, it is used in classification problems.

DataSet -> Algorithm -> M/C

Let's talk about this.

So a (Training) DataSet is given to your Algorithm, which then generates your Model/Classifier.

An unlabeled sample input (TEST) is given to this Model/Classifier, which then tells us which class that smaple belongs to.

The Model/Classifier is Tree-Structured. Where:

Decisioon Node (Test) -> Head.
Leaf Node -> Classification Values.
Test is performed on the basis of Features/Attributes (Values).
